    <h1>How I Plan to Eat a Turkey that has Received a Thanksgiving Day Presidential Pardon.</h1>
    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> AC Murph is one of the birthday boys. </p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>   There are very few stranger traditions in the United States than the yearly presidential pardon of a Thanksgiving-day turkey.  Even fewer people look at that tradition and ask "why the literaly heck are we pardoning those turkeys."  <br>
        What if I told you that this was intentional. <br>
        What if there were a reason all those turkeys were pardoned and no one every questioned it. <br>
    In this talk, I will discuss the history of the thanksgiving-day presidential turkey pardon, unveil a long history of state secrets concerning this pardon, and explain the why and how I plan to one day soon consume one of these turkeys. <br><br>
