    <h1>Radical Empathy Through Story Exchanges</h1>
    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Megan Kite is a human who loves willow trees, art that evokes sadness, and salty snacks. She enjoys work that involves people, particularly the ones at the tails of the age bell curve. Before she dies, she hopes to swim with a blue whale and gaze into its eyes. </p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>The highest aim of storytelling is the cultivation of empathy- to dethrone yourself from the center of the world and let someone else sit there for a moment. Empathy demands that we connect with others' experiences and feelings in a genuine way. We cannot do that from afar. It requires a certain level of spiritual proximity, loving curiosity, and emotional vulnerability. 

Humans aren’t born with empathy, but it can be developed. In an attempt to foster radical empathy in the next generation, Narrative 4 developed the Story Exchange program. At a Story Exchange, participants are paired up and asked to share stories with one another and then retell them in front of the group. Through deep listening, personal storytelling, and perspective taking, the Story Exchange aims to activate and impact the brain’s emphatic centers. Prior participants reported increased levels of happiness, better relationships, and stronger community ties. Story Exchanges have the power to transform perceptions, create connections, and drive change. 

I hope to demonstrate the potential of the Story Exchange at the JBB 2025 Conference through a facilitated session.<br><br>
