    <h1>Ancient and Medieval Graffiti and Drawings</h1>
    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Rocky is a very, very amateur historian who gets into internet
deep-dives from time to time. They get hella excited about castle ruins, historic
train depots, special collection libraries, and how human imprints and attitudes
survive the test of time.</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A comedic PowerPoint presentation on a selection of ancient and
medieval graffiti and drawings, intended to inform audience members of the
various ways some people expressed themselves on paper (or on walls), and how
humankind has always been silly. Topics will cover Pompeiian graffiti, the doodles of
7-year-old Onfim from 13th century Novgorod, Russia, and the banal and
inconsiderate graffiti of Viking travelers. Powerpoint will contain illustrations and
photographs of historic sites and artifacts from archival media troves. If materials
can be found, birchbark and styluses may be handed to conference participants for
an interactive experience.<br><br>
