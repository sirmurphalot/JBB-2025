    <h1>Your Stomach Is Outside Your Body: A Drunk Ramble On the Inside of the Outside of your “Insides"</h1>
    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Christopher Stoll</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Humans like to think of themselves as solid, sealed, self-contained beings. But biology says otherwise. In this inebriated exploration of gastrointestinal geometry, we’ll confront the horrifying truth: your stomach is actually outside your body. The digestive tract, from mouth to anus, is not inside you, but rather a continuous external tunnel running through you. You’re not a meat puppet that happens to have a gut. You’re a donut with depression.<br>

Fun fun fun. This lecture proposes that the human body is less a sealed organism and more a confused biological torus. A wet, muscular tube bent into pretzel form. Through a mix of legitimate anatomy, questionable logic, and half-remembered biology, we’ll examine how evolution accidentally made every animal a walking water wiggler toy: <br>

By the end of this talk, attendees will:<br>
<ol>
    <li>Doubt their entire understanding of “inside” and “outside.”</li>
    <li>Be unable to eat spaghetti without picturing a self-cleaning wormhole.</li>
    <li>Appreciate the human digestive system as nature’s longest slip-n-slide.</li>
    <li>Maybe learn a real biological fact or two (but let’s not get our hopes up).</li>
