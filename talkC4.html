    <h1> Graveyard Smash: The Evolution and Queer History of Gothic Literature and Why the Song “Monster Mash” Is Probably the Most Famous Queer Orgy in History</h1>
    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Aries Aries Aries</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We will examine the historic intersection of queer theory and Gothic literature. Since its inception, the Gothic has been written by, about, and for the queer community. Its recurring motifs—monstrosity, transgression, transformation, and the supernatural—serve as metaphors for queerness and social otherness. From the erotic perversions of Dracula and the sapphic intimacy of Carmilla, to the political and gendered explorations of humanity and rebirth in Frankenstein, Gothic narratives have mirrored queer lived experience while celebrating beauty in subversion. Monsters, after all, are hot.<br>
This presentation traces the evolution of Gothic expression from the dark Romanticism of the 18th century to the camp-infused horror of the late 20th century. Works like Buffy the Vampire Slayer extend the Gothic’s lineage through irony and humor, using (hot) monsters to explore queerness, kink, and polyamory in ways that resonate with youth cultures through postmodern camp.<br>
Finally, the 1962 novelty hit Monster Mash by Bobby “Boris” Pickett is reconsidered as a queer Gothic text. Beneath its playful absurdity lies a grotesque celebration of the undead—an interspecies, multi-gendered orgy where boundaries between life and death, human and monster, lover and fiend blur beyond recognition. Drawing on works such as Laura Westengard’s Queer Gothic Literature and Culture (2022) and B. J. Kirkpatrick’s The Queer Gothic (2013), this project proposes that Monster Mash is not merely a Halloween anthem but a jubilant, queer Gothic sexual manifesto centuries in the making.<br><br>
