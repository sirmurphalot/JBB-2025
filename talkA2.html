    <h1>The Secret Life of Butts: The Science of the Brain-Butt Connection And The Art Of Unclenching</h1>
    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong>The Unclenched Wench is a certified somatic practitioner and body-oriented coach specializing in nervous system repatterning, mind-body attunement, and being a silly goose. Her work is deeply accessible, playful, and trauma-informed, with particular focus supporting neurodivergent folks (including ADHD, autism, and dyslexia) in cultivating sensory safety and ease in their bodies. Her work helps people to unwind chronic tension, reconnect with internal pacing, and discover that softness is both possible and allowed. Her philosophy begins with the smallest of invitations: sometimes the first step toward peace is simply unclenching your butt.</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Most of us are walking around with our butts clenched like they’re guarding deep-state secrets. But what if your butthole isn’t just an innocent bystander…it’s actually a major player in your emotional life? In this workshop, we will explore the highly underrated and deeply expressive world of butts, hips, and the pelvic floor. We’ll dive into the neuroscience of butt-related stress and how the body decides (without asking you) when to clench, tighten, brace, or release. We’ll explore how the pelvic floor, diaphragm, and vagus nerve form a single functional system that influences your emotional regulation, stress response, and sense of safety in your body.<br>

Together we’ll explore:<br>
• Diaphragmatic breathing that supports ease in the low belly, bladder, pelvic floor (and butt, of course)<br>
• Bottom-up regulation tools to help convince the body that it is not in fact being chased by a bear<br>
• Partner and group co-regulation practices so no one has to unclench alone.<br>

Come learn, breathe, connect, and leave with a noticeably softer and juicier butt.<br><br>
