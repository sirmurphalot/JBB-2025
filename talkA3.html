    <h1>By Your Own Hand: a Very Basic Drawing Tutorial</h1>
    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Kristi Kong is an adopted child of Murph’s from undergrad, Kristi is a self-employed illustrator in
Pennsylvania. They come from an intersectional background as a queer
Taiwanese-American, which has most likely contributed to their diverse experience in both
the sciences and the arts, the cerebral and the athletic, and their love for both cats and
dogs (cats a little more). Kristi hopes to have a fun, stress-free drawing session with
everyone at the JBB 2025!</p>
    <p><strong>Let’s draw a hand together! The human hand is universally recognized as one of the most
intimidating subjects to draw due to its complex structure and organic movement. I will be
demystifying the process of drawing The Manus by simplifying it into three steps: form,
contour, and shading. Guiding JBB 2025 attendants through the fundamentals of pencil
drawing in this 20-minute workshop, I will include a live tutorial, completely subjective
opinions on how to approach a drawing, and some possible philosophical digressions on
the importance of making space for human-made art. No prior experience needed or
expected! The ultimate goal of this session will be creating by your own hand.<br><br>
