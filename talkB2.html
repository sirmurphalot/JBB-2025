    <h1>The Butterfly Effect: Admiring the Ripples of Change through Time, from the Titanic to Costco</h1>
    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> John Michael Hailey is one of the Birthday Boys. </p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>    One small movement by anyone can change the course.  Your coffee order today could cause an avalanche in Nepal.  You just may never know.  Thankfully, with 20/20 hindsight, we are able to witness and appreciate the ripples of change through time. In this talk, we will examine specific examples of how seemingly unrelated events are actually extremely connected and you may never look at a Costco hot dog the same way again.          <br><br>
