    <h1>If the Mafia Ran a Summer Camp: Lessons Learned from a Former Professional Carnie</h1>
    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Lynne Osthus is a stay-at-home mom, smut enthusiast, and fourth-generation carnie turned accidental scholar. Once arrested (and proudly found not guilty), she now occupies her time with horror, hiking, and waiting patiently for Halloween.</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> If the mafia ran a summer camp, it would look a lot like the carnival—family-run, rule-bending, and weirdly well-organized.

Fourth-generation carnie Lynne Osthus translates the secret slang and social order of life on the midway, then dives into how state laws keep games just fair enough. Through an interactive duck pond demo, participants will see how legality and illusion share the same tent.<br><br>
