    <h1>The Government Should Sell Illicit Drugs</h1>
    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Chris Nagy is a washed up (pun intended) retired college swimmer who managed to
pick up two degrees along the way. Chris has never used drugs, does not have the desire to use drugs,
has never even seen drugs, does not plan on ever being in a situation that involves drugs, but is
annoyed by the weaponized incompetence of government in the modern era and thinks he knows better. </p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>The “War on Drugs” started in the 70’s, and enough time has passed to confidently say that the score is
1-0 on the side of drugs. And although we’ve had superb leadership who tried nothing but the best,
most brilliant ideas to win the war, their efforts have only caused this problem to get worse. It’s about
time we stop going after the symptoms of this drug problem, and go straight for the causes, and we do
this by attacking the incentive structure of the drug trade. I propose that the US government should sell
illegal drugs, legally.<br>
The plan would entail government-run businesses where any individual would be able to walk in and
purchase any drug you could possibly imagine, all for less than market price to undercut the
competition. The government should not do this alone; they will hire on existing experts from the field,
including sellers, distributors, and producers. Drug cartels should be hired as consultants and
government contractors.<br>
Also importantly with this proposal: the government must provide rehabilitation services at the same
location. People must be made fully aware of the risks of drug use. The government must educate
people and do their absolute best to help people. This plan is not to encourage more drug use. It hopes
to disrupt the supply chain to disincentivize illegal activity, create jobs, and ultimately break
dependence on drugs that too many people suffer from.<br><br>
