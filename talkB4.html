    <h1>Through the Eyes of a 5-Year-Old: An Immersive Introduction to Pediatric Occupational Therapy</h1>
    <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Jared Peltzman</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Step into the sensory-rich world of a pediatric OT clinic—no referral required! In this hands-on, movement-based workshop, participants will journey through an immersive obstacle course inspired by real therapeutic activities designed for neurodivergent children. You’ll crawl through a steamroller, swing in lycra hammocks, bounce on a trampoline, and navigate a multi-step challenge involving working memory, sequencing, coordination, and self-regulation. <br>



Each station highlights a different aspect of development—reflex integration, balance, executive function, praxis, and sensory processing—bringing to life the daily challenges and triumphs of pediatric clients. You’ll also get a crash course in visual-motor integration with a DIY twist on the Beery VMI, learn how to co-regulate through slime-making, and try out tools like Zones of Regulation, five-finger breathing, and Alert Program strategies for identifying high vs. low arousal states.<br>



Whether you’re neurodivergent, neurotypical, or neuro-curious, this is your chance to think, feel, and move like a 5-year-old—and discover how fun (and challenging) that can be.<br>



Comfortable clothes encouraged but not mandatory. Curiosity required.<br><br>
